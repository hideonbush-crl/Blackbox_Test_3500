# Summary

### Problem space
#### Music sharing
- Music sharing in general usually takes place between friends. 
- Music sharing between strangers often happens on the internet.

### Design Opportunity
- Many UQ students often choose to stay on their own, listening to music during their gap time between classes.
- Music can build interpersonal relationships between young people because the same musical preferences can be a clue to similar values, and similarities in values contribute to social attraction. For friendship development, social attraction is the first social process that may contribute to relationship development.
- Young people want to make friends with people who have similar interests to their own.

### Our solution
In the gap time between classes, music is used to allow UQ students to create communication and improve social interaction between students by allowing them to find common ground through the same musical preferences.


## Designing and Prototyping Process
## Literature Research
### Literature Research:
#### Part 1: Domain Research
-	The users in their 20s wish to share their musical taste with various people, not only with their acquaintances, in everyday spaces and when on the move.
-	Interactions between collocated strangers and sharing of song choices can create a sense of commonality between them.
-	Music can create interpersonal bonds between young people as music preferences can be cues for similar or dissimilar value orientations, with similarity in values then contributing to social attraction.

#### Part 2: Observation, survey, and interviews between UQ students
