# Blackbox_Test_3500

MusiX is the project for DECO3500 Social & Mobile Computing Course from the Blackbox test team. MusiX is created for UQ students who are bored during gap time between classes at the Great Court. It aims to enhance face-to-face conversation and social interaction through music sharing to make the most of their free time.

## Summary

### Problem space
#### Music sharing
- Music sharing in general usually takes place between friends. 
- Music sharing between strangers often happens on the internet.

### Design Opportunity
- Many UQ students often choose to stay on their own, listening to music during their gap time between classes.
- Music can build interpersonal relationships between young people because the same musical preferences can be a clue to similar values, and similarities in values contribute to social attraction. For friendship development, social attraction is the first social process that may contribute to relationship development.
- Young people want to make friends with people who have similar interests to their own.

### Our solution
In the gap time between classes, music is used to allow UQ students to create communication and improve social interaction between students by allowing them to find common ground through the same musical preferences.


## Designing and Prototyping Process
### Observation, survey, and interviews:

#### Part 1: Observation, survey, and interviews between UQ students
- UQ students get bored during the gap time.
- Students like to spend their gap time in the Great Court, and some also intend to make friends during that time. 

### Literature Research
#### Part 2: Domain Research
-	The users in their 20s wish to share their musical taste with various people, not only with their acquaintances, in everyday spaces and when on the move.
-	Interactions between collocated strangers and sharing of song choices can create a sense of commonality between them.
-	Music can create interpersonal bonds between young people as music preferences can be cues for similar or dissimilar value orientations, with similarity in values then contributing to social attraction.
- Sharing music in a shared space helps people to interact with each other in a face-to-face manner.
- Young people are willing to make friends with similar interests.


#### Part 3: Existing solutions
Although there are a variety of music-sharing apps on the market today, most of them are for sharing between friends, while those for sharing between strangers are on the internet and rarely focus on face-to-face communication and interaction. 

For existing design attempts from research, the focus has been on young people listening to other people's music randomly. Alternatively, some attempts do not clearly show the user's music preferences, which may lead to problems such as not having an icebreaker topic to start the conversation.

### Future direction
- Further improvements may be made to the listen together function; for example, when user one chooses to listen to a song with user two, user two will be aware that someone is listening with her/him. Corresponding features may be developed, such as showing who is listening to the music with me on the map.
- Focus more on those who are shared to make it easier and more accurate for them to receive and give feedback on otherâ€™s music.
